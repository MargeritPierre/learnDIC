# learnDIC: a practical introduction to Digital Image Correlation with Python.


*Practical sessions for the `Identification` class of the [Material and Structures Durability](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/master-dms-durabilite-materiaux-structures) Master of [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/en)*

The course is organized as a series of progressive examples implementing DIC techniques:
- Local DIC:
  1. *1D uniform* translation of a gaussian - u(x) = U
  2. *1D affine* transformation of a gaussian - u(x) = u1*(1-x) + u2*x
  3. *2D uniform* translation of a gaussian - **u**(**x**) = **U**
- Global DIC: **u**(**x**) = **N**(**x**).**U**
  1. Without regularization
  2. With regularization on the second gradient
